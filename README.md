## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services not starting**: 
   - Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
   - Check ports: `lsof -i :8080` (repeat for all ports)
   - View logs: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`

2. **COBOL compilation errors**:
   - Check GnuCOBOL installation: `docker exec cobol-compiler cobc --version`
   - Verify COBOL syntax in `cobol-core/` directory

3. **Database connection issues**:
   - Wait for MySQL to fully initialize (can take 30-60 seconds)
   - Check credentials in `.env` file
   - Run: `docker exec cobol-bridge-mysql mysql -u suitecrm -psuitecrm123 -e "SHOW DATABASES;"`

4. **WebSocket connection failures**:
   - Ensure no firewall blocking WebSocket ports
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API Gateway is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Stop all services and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Remove all images
docker-compose rm -f

# Start fresh
./start.sh
```

## üéØ Quick Demo Script
